# godot-audio-engine-test

An audio manager with different properties such as custom loop points, manual transitions and on-beat transitions. Made with Godot 4.1

This project was made as a way to test my skills on Godot. Feel free to use this as a tool for your games, but don't expect it to be perfect.
